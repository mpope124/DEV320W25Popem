<h1>Web Resources</h1>
<br/>   
<h2>W3 Schools HTML</h2>
<p>W3 schools is one of the best free resources that will provide you a lot of information about HTML. This is a resource that pops up first on google whenever you want to learn something new about HTML or have a question on how to code something in HTML. This is a reference that I will refer to the most often.</p>

<h2>Mozilla Developer Tools</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Developer tools is the second place that I will look for information for webpage development if W3 schools doesnt have the information that I need. This webpage is sometimes a little too technical and be a little diffcult to understand but is helpful non the less.</p>
